It is a container management service. We can create self-contained environments know as containers.

“DockerNet” is not a commonly used term in the context of Docker, but it likely refers to Docker networks—a feature in Docker that enables containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.

Here’s a detailed explanation:

Docker Networking

Docker networking allows containers to communicate with:
	1.	Each other (in the same or different networks).
	2.	The host machine.
	3.	External networks, like the internet.

Docker automatically creates and manages networks to ensure containers are isolated and can interact as needed.

Types of Docker Networks

Docker provides several types of networks:
	1.	Bridge Network (Default):
	•	Used when containers need to communicate on the same host.
	•	Containers in the same bridge network can communicate using their container names.
	•	Example:

docker network create my_bridge_network
docker run --network my_bridge_network --name container1 my_image
docker run --network my_bridge_network --name container2 my_image

In this setup, container1 can ping container2 using its name.

	2.	Host Network:
	•	The container shares the host machine’s network stack.
	•	Used for performance-critical applications where networking overhead must be minimized.
	•	Example:

docker run --network host my_image


	3.	None:
	•	The container has no network interface.
	•	Typically used for security or debugging.
	•	Example:

docker run --network none my_image


	4.	Overlay Network:
	•	Allows containers on different hosts (in a Docker Swarm or Kubernetes cluster) to communicate.
	•	Example:

docker network create -d overlay my_overlay_network


	5.	Macvlan Network:
	•	Assigns a MAC address to each container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.
	•	Used for low-level network integration.

Commands to Manage Docker Networks

	1.	List networks:

docker network ls


	2.	Inspect a network:

docker network inspect <network_name>


	3.	Create a network:

docker network create <network_name>


	4.	Connect a container to a network:

docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>


	5.	Disconnect a container from a network:

docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>

When to Use Docker Networks

	•	Use bridge networks for communication between containers on the same host.
	•	Use overlay networks in multi-host setups, such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
	•	Use host networks for performance-critical workloads.
	•	Use none for isolated containers.
