GitHub is a cloud-based platform designed for software developers to collaborate on projects and manage code using Git, a version control system. It provides tools for source code management, version tracking, team collaboration, and deployment. GitHub is widely used for both open-source and private projects.

Key Features of GitHub

	1.	Version Control with Git:
		Tracks changes in code over time, allowing developers to collaborate and roll back to previous versions if needed.
	2.	Repositories:
		A repository (or “repo”) is a storage space for your project files, including code, documentation, and other resources.
	3.	Branching and Merging:
		Developers can create branches to work on separate features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
		Changes can be merged back into the main branch after review.
	4.	Pull Requests (PRs):
		Developers propose changes to a codebase via PRs.
		Other team members can review, comment on, and approve these changes before merging them.
	5.	Issues and Bug Tracking:
		Allows teams to create, discuss, and track issues, feature requests, or bugs.
	6.	Collaboration Tools:
		Built-in code review tools, commenting, and project management boards.
	7.	Actions (CI/CD):
		Automate workflows like building, testing, and deploying code using GitHub Actions.
	8.	Open Source Contributions:
		Developers can share code publicly and collaborate on open-source projects.
	9.	Security Tools:
		Scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
		Enforces best practices with code scanning and secret detection.
	10.	Integration with Other Tools:
		Seamlessly integrates with IDEs, CI/CD tools, cloud platforms, and more.

Common GitHub Terminology

	1.	Repository (Repo):
		A project’s storage that contains all files, code, and revision history.
	2.	Commit:
		A snapshot of changes made to the code, along with a message describing the update.
	3.	Branch:
		A separate version of the codebase used for development or experimentation.
	4.	Fork:
		A copy of a repository that you can modify independently from the original project.
	5.	Pull Request (PR):
		A request to merge changes from one branch or fork into another.
	6.	Clone:
		A local copy of a GitHub repository created on your computer.
	7.	README:
		A markdown file included in repositories that explains the project, how to use it, and other details.

How GitHub Works

	1.	Host Your Code:
		Create a repository and push your local code to it using Git commands.
		Example:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main


	2.	Collaborate:
		Share the repository with team members.
		Collaborate using branches, pull requests, and code reviews.
	3.	Manage Versions:
		Track changes over time with commits.
		Revert to previous states if needed.
	4.	Automate:
		Use GitHub Actions to set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, builds, and deployments.

GitHub for Open Source and Private Projects

	•	Open Source: Free to use for public repositories. Developers worldwide can contribute.
	•	Private Projects: Secure hosting for private codebases with paid plans for organizations.

Why Use GitHub?

	•	Collaboration: Ideal for teams to work together on code.
	•	Version Control: Keeps track of every change, preventing code loss.
	•	Integration: Works well with other tools and platforms.
	•	Community: Large open-source ecosystem and community support
	
Here’s a walkthrough of GitHub basics, including commands and steps to set up your project and collaborate effectively.

1. Setting Up GitHub

Prerequisites

	•	Install Git: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
	•	Create a GitHub Account: Sign up at GitHub.

2. Starting a New GitHub Project

Step 1: Create a Repository on GitHub

	1.	Log in to your GitHub account.
	2.	Click the green “New” button or navigate to Repositories > New.
	3.	Fill in:
		Repository name (e.g., my-first-repo).
		Description (optional).
		Choose Public or Private.
	4.	Click “Create repository”.

Step 2: Clone the Repository Locally

Copy the repository’s URL and clone it to your computer:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

3. Adding and Committing Files

	1.	Add Files:
		Add files to your local repository folder.
		Use the following command to stage files:

git add .

This stages all changes in the folder for commit.

	2.	Commit Changes:
		Save a snapshot of your changes:

git commit -m "Initial commit"


	3.	Push Changes to GitHub:
		Send your local commits to the GitHub repository:

git push origin main

4. Collaborating on GitHub

Step 1: Create a New Branch

	Branches are used to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase:

git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature



Step 2: Make Changes and Push the Branch

	Edit your code and commit changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"


	Push the branch to GitHub:

git push origin feature/my-new-feature



Step 3: Create a Pull Request (PR)

	Go to your GitHub repository.
	Click “Pull Requests” > “New Pull Request”.
	Compare your branch (feature/my-new-feature) with the main branch.
	Add a description and submit the pull request.

Step 4: Review and Merge

	Team members review the pull request.
	After approval, merge it into the main branch.
	Optionally delete the branch.

5. Updating Local Code

Always update your local repository to stay in sync with GitHub:

git pull origin main

6. GitHub Actions (Automation)

	1.	Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline:
		Create a .github/workflows/ci.yml file to automate testing, building, or deployment.
		Example YAML for Node.js testing:

name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test


	2.	Push the Workflow:
		GitHub Actions will automatically run when code is pushed.
