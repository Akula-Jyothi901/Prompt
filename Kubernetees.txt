Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform for managing and orchestrating containerized applications. It automates tasks such as deployment, scaling, and managing containerized workloads, making it easier to run applications reliably in any environment.

Key Features of Kubernetes

	1.	Container Orchestration:
		Automatically manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers (e.g., Docker containers).
	2.	Scalability:
	              Can automatically scale applications up or down based on demand or defined metrics.
	3.	Self-Healing:
		Restarts failed containers.
		Replaces containers if they crash or become unresponsive.
		Reschedules containers if a node fails.
	4.	Load Balancing:
		Distributes network traffic evenly across containers to ensure high availability.
	5.	Declarative Configuration:
		Uses YAML or JSON files to define the desired state of the application (e.g., number of replicas, resource limits).
		Kubernetes ensures the system matches the desired state.
	6.	Multi-Environment Support:
		Can run on-premises, in the cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), or in hybrid setups.
	7.	Service Discovery and Networking:
		Provides internal DNS to allow containers to discover and communicate with each other.
		Supports advanced networking configurations.
	8.	Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:
		Updates applications incrementally to ensure zero downtime.
		Can roll back changes if something goes wrong.

Core Concepts in Kubernetes

	1.	Cluster:
		A collection of machines (nodes) where Kubernetes runs containerized applications.
		Consists of:
		Control Plane: Manages the cluster (e.g., API Server, Scheduler).
		Worker Nodes: Run the actual application containers.
	2.	Pod:
		The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
		Represents one or more containers that share storage, networking, and specifications.
	3.	Node:
		A physical or virtual machine in the cluster that runs Pods.
	4.	Service:
		Exposes an application running in a set of Pods as a network service, making it accessible to other components or users.
	5.	Deployment:
		Manages the desired state of application Pods and handles scaling and updates.
	6.	Namespace:
		A logical partition within a cluster to isolate workloads (e.g., for development, testing, and production).
	7.	Ingress:
		Manages external access to services, typically via HTTP or HTTPS.
	8.	ConfigMap/Secret:
		Stores configuration data or sensitive information for applications.

How Kubernetes Works

	1.	You Define the Desired State:
		For example, a Deployment YAML specifies that you want 5 replicas of a containerized web app.
	2.	Kubernetes Ensures the Desired State:
		It schedules containers to run on nodes, monitors their health, and restarts or moves them if needed.
	3.	Handles Scaling and Updates:
		Automatically adjusts the number of containers based on resource usage.
		Performs rolling updates with zero downtime.

Benefits of Kubernetes

	•	Portability: Run anywhere (on-premises, cloud, hybrid).
	•	High Availability: Ensures application uptime through redundancy and self-healing.
	•	Efficient Resource Usage: Optimizes the use of hardware resources.
	•	Automation: Reduces the manual effort needed for managing applications.
	•	Ecosystem Integration: Integrates with many tools (e.g., Helm, Prometheus, Istio).

Kubernetes vs Docker

	•	Docker is a container runtime that allows you to create and run containers.
	•	Kubernetes is an orchestrator that manages multiple containers and coordinates them across machines.

They are often used together: Docker to create containers and Kubernetes to manage and orchestrate them.
