Prompt 1: Initial Analysis
I need to implement a Behave BDD scenario for Rfuel based on an existing Jag framework test. 
Context:
- Jag reference scenario: D:\bdd_jag\features\AC-4011_OPTIC_Pay_Once_for_Food_and_Fuel\RPOS-4993_Optic_KAM_Need_to_receive_notifications_from_Fuel_Controller_for_all_state_changes.feature (Scenario: Prepay, fuel below tender amount)
- Target feature file: D:\RetalixFuel-BDD-main\Retalix\bdd\features\PerPay.feature
- Proxy files: fuelcontrol_proxy.py, simpump_proxy.py
- C++ APIs available in: D:\C++
Please analyze the Jag scenario and list:
1. What steps are needed for the Rfuel implementation
2. Which existing proxy APIs can be reused
3. Which new proxy wrappers need to be created
4. Any gaps between Jag and Rfuel frameworks

Prompt 2: Feature File Generation
Generate the Behave feature scenario for PerPay.feature with this test case:
Scenario: Prepay - Prepay Unbalanced transaction
  Given Initializing GPI Interfaces
  When I select pump <pump_number>
  And I Authorize Prepay for $<auth_amount> on pump
  And I Set the flow rate on pump to <flow_rate>
  And the nozzle is lifted on pump
  And the grade is selected on pump
  Then fueling is started on pump
  And I fuel <Fuel_amount>
  And I hang up the nozzle
  And the configured prompt 'YOURCHANGE' is displayed
  And the ICR should display welcome prompt
  And Clear the Prepay transaction
Examples:
  | pump_number | auth_amount | flow_rate | Fuel_amount |
  | "1"         | 5000        | 20        | 2000        |
Follow the existing feature file structure in D:\RetalixFuel-BDD-main\Retalix\bdd\features\

Prompt 3: Proxy API Wrappers
Based on the scenario steps, I need to create Python proxy wrappers in fuelcontrol_proxy.py for these C++ FCC APIs:
[List the APIs you identified from C++ folder(D:\C++)]
Requirements:
1. Follow the existing proxy pattern in fuelcontrol_proxy.py
2. Add only the raw APIs.
3. Include docstrings with parameter descriptions
4. Return appropriate data types for Behave assertions
5.Constants move to the enums\pumps.py
Generate the proxy wrapper functions.

Prompt 4: Step Definitions
Create Behave step definitions for the new scenario steps that don't exist yet.
Context:
- Use ONLY proxy APIs from fuelcontrol_proxy.py and simpump_proxy.py
- Follow existing step patterns in D:\RetalixFuel-BDD-main\Retalix\bdd\features\steps\
- Reuse existing steps where possible
- Add logging for each step execution
New steps needed:
[List steps that don't exist in current framework]
Generate the step definition code with proper decorators (@given, @when, @then).

Prompt 5: Validation & Integration
Review the complete implementation:
1. Verify all proxy APIs are properly imported in step definitions
2. Check parameter passing from feature file to steps
3. Ensure proper wait/polling for pump state changes
4. Add assertions for expected outcomes
5. Suggest any error handling improvements
Provide a checklist of what to verify before running the test.
